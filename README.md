Bruteforce Bootloader Unlocker for android smartphones with fastboot support. 
You can modify the script to iterate through a combination of numbers and letters as the unlock code. First, we need to define an alphabet array containing the characters to use in the unlock code. Then, we can modify the loop in the script to use the characters from both the number range and the alphabet array.

The script uses a combination of numbers (0-9) and lowercase letters (a-f) in the unlock code, with a range of 0-255. You can further customize the alphabet array and the min_code, max_code, and step variables to suit your needs.

Keep in mind that the length of the alphabet array and the max_code value should be adjusted if you want to use more characters or a longer unlock code.

Please note that this example is specific to numbers and lowercase letters. You can modify the alphabet array to include uppercase letters, symbols, or other characters
